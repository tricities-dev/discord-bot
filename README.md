# Vertex

A Discord bot for the best Discord community out there, TriDev. Vertex comes jam packed with features that make your community come alive. Curl up by a nice Flame War Friday, and enjoy the ride

## Getting Started

1. Install the Rust toolchain for your system: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
2. Open an issue for @jaketothepast to add you to the Discord developer team.
3. Compile and run the bot locally, with the correct Discord bot token.

## Discord Environments

We currently have two applications

1. Vertex - the production app, used to power our prod bot user.
2. Vertex Test - our private app, used as a staging ground for new bot features.
